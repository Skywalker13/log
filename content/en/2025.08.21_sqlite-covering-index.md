I recently discovered a somewhat surprising optimization that can be done with
[SQLite][5]. But first, what is a covering index (or [covering index][4])? It's
an index that contains all the columns necessary to answer the query without the
SQL engine needing to access the table. This obviously saves time. But like any
index, we'll lose time on insertion, as long as we consider that significant for
our application, which isn't a problem in my case.

## An ordinary table

There's nothing special about having covering indexes. But before going further,
I'll present you with a very simple table like you might see in many software
applications.

```sql
CREATE TABLE data (
  rowid     INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  timestamp TEXT,
  payload   JSON,
  commitId  TEXT DEFAULT NULL
);

CREATE INDEX commitId ON data (commitId);
```

This table has an index which is the primary key `rowid` and auto-incremented.
The `rowid` column is special in SQLite because it always exists even if we
don't explicitly declare it in the schema and don't explicitly request a table
without `rowid` ([WITHOUT ROWID][1]).

The goal with this table is that the `rowid` is [never recycled][6] in case of
row deletion. By not explicitly declaring an `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` column in the
schema, it's entirely possible for a `rowid` to be reused. For our usage here,
we'll guarantee that the `rowid` only increments. The `rowid` being a [64-bit
identifier][2] used at the storage level, it's not an index like others. Data
access based on the `rowid` is much faster and more optimized than with an
ordinary index.

## An ordinary query

Here's a query needed in this application. It will count how many rows there are
with a `rowid` greater than the largest `rowid` that exists for a given
`commitId`. You should understand that the same `commitId` can appear multiple
times in the table; moreover, it's not a unique index.

```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM data
WHERE rowid > (
  SELECT max(rowid)
  FROM data
  WHERE commitId = 'abcd'
);
```

Example with some data:

| rowid | timestamp                | payload | commitId |     |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ------- | -------- | --- |
| 1     | 2025-08-21T09:52:11.245Z | {...}   | _abcd_   |     |
| 2     | 2025-08-21T09:52:11.245Z | {...}   | _abcd_   |     |
| 3     | 2025-08-21T09:52:11.245Z | {...}   | ef01     |     |
| 11    | 2025-08-21T09:52:11.245Z | {...}   | _abcd_   |     |
| 13    | 2025-08-21T09:52:11.245Z | {...}   | ef01     | x   |
| 14    | 2025-08-21T09:52:11.245Z | {...}   | 2345     | x   |

For the `commitId` `abcd`, the query will return the value 2 (the `rowid`s 13
and 14 are greater than the largest `rowid` used by the `commitId` `abcd` which
is 11).

I think that like me, you find all this quite simple and ordinary. The only
particularity of this query is the use of a subquery to retrieve the largest
`rowid` associated with a `commitId`. You certainly agree with me that this
should be quite efficient because the subquery can exploit the `commitId` index
to reduce the amount of data in which to find the `max`. Moreover, in the
application, there are very rarely many rows for the same `commitId` (less than
ten).

### Let's verify what I'm telling you

Using `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` with our `SELECT ...` we'll be able to verify that
I'm not telling you nonsense.

| id  | parent | detail                                                 |
| --- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 3   | 0      | SEARCH data USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid>?)        |
| 6   | 0      | SCALAR SUBQUERY 1                                      |
| 11  | 6      | SEARCH data USING COVERING INDEX commitId (commitId=?) |

This seems very good and even wonderful. The subquery indeed uses the `commitId`
index and moreover in covering mode because we don't access anything other than
the index to resolve the condition `commitId = 'abcd'`. Regarding the condition
with `rowid > (...)` we access the primary key index. We can imagine that it's
very performant because we directly use the `rowid` of the SQLite table.

### Query performance

Let's then take a look at performance with a table that contains about 200,000
rows and a `commitId` that is located almost in the middle of it. There are only
3 rows (with the subquery) for this `commitId`.

```
$ sqlite3 data.db
SQLite version 3.46.1 2024-08-13 09:16:08
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> .timer on
sqlite> SELECT count(*)
FROM data
WHERE rowid > (
  SELECT max(rowid)
  FROM data
  WHERE commitId = '81b5f0ae-7f4a-4db2-ae3f-dea5bd35e0ad'
);
93356
Run Time: real 0.031 user 0.007897 sys 0.023278
sqlite> SELECT count(*) ...
93356
Run Time: real 0.038 user 0.007570 sys 0.030460
sqlite> SELECT count(*) ...
93356
Run Time: real 0.038 user 0.003727 sys 0.033857
sqlite> SELECT count(*) ...
93356
Run Time: real 0.033 user 0.011919 sys 0.020516
```

The `.timer on` instruction enables a timer for each executed query. Here's what
emerges:

|     | time  |
| --- | ----- |
| 0   | 31 ms |
| 1   | 38 ms |
| 2   | 38 ms |
| 3   | 33 ms |

I don't know what you think about it, but I'm not satisfied with the result. I
can execute this query dozens of times, it never goes below 30 ms. Don't you
find that it's a bit slow? There aren't that many rows, the schema is simple,
the queries are simple, the query planner is satisfied.

## But what's happening?

That's an excellent question and it's the whole subject of this article. There's
a way to drastically improve the performance of this query. Here's a measurement
with the change that I'll present to you below (don't jump directly to the end
of the article, try to imagine how to improve the performance of this `SELECT`
by going back to review the schema and what the query planner said).

```

);

```

|     | before | after |
| --- | ------ | ----- |
| 0   | 31 ms  | 2 ms  |
| 1   | 38 ms  | 2 ms  |
| 2   | 38 ms  | 5 ms  |
| 3   | 33 ms  | 4 ms  |

We go from more than 30 ms to a few milliseconds. To understand what's happening
here, we need to re-examine what the query planner told us earlier and
especially the first line `SEARCH data USING INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (rowid>?)`.
Here it's not said that SQLite will use a covering index, but only that SQLite
will use the index on the primary key. But ultimately, what does that mean in
this case?

This primary key is not an ordinary index because it's the identifier that
allows finding a record in the table. Which means you have to access the table
to access this key. It's very performant if you want to extract a record from
the table like for example with a simple
`SELECT * FROM data WHERE rowid = 101256;`. A `SELECT` of this type must
necessarily go fetch the data and it's better to know the identifier directly
and not waste time with an intermediate index.

But what to do for the `SELECT count(*) ...`? We need a covering index. Thus
SQLite won't access the storage pages to find the `rowid`s. Not accessing
storage avoids loading the other columns of the table. If you look carefully at
the schema, there's a `payload` column. This column can contain large `JSON`
documents. It's a rather heavy column and here, it's sufficient to make the
query less efficient even though we're not interested in the `payload` at all.

## The mystery solved

```sql
CREATE INDEX rowId ON data (rowId);
```

OMG ?! 😱

We're creating an index on top of a primary key. Have we gone mad? Even the
**Great** [Richard Hipp][3] (author of SQLite) tells us:

Let's see what the query planner tells us...

| id  | parent | detail                                                 |
| --- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 3   | 0      | SEARCH data USING COVERING INDEX rowId (rowid>?)       |
| 6   | 0      | SCALAR SUBQUERY 1                                      |
| 11  | 6      | SEARCH data USING COVERING INDEX commitId (commitId=?) |

Now it's indeed the covering index that's being used. We're then faced with a
case where adding an index on top of a primary key will drastically improve the
performance of this `SELECT`.

Note that if I remove the `payload` column and retest the query without the
covering index on `rowid`, I get about 9 ms instead of more than 30 ms.

## Conclusion

What you should remember is that with an `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, SQLite must load
complete pages (with `payload`). But with the covering index ([covering
index][4]), SQLite only reads the lightweight index.

These different experiments show a little-known particularity of the SQLite
engine. We can probably consider this behavior as an edge case with subtleties
between the query optimizer, covering indexes and aggregation operations with
large volumes. I won't advise you to do it, but I encourage you to inspect and
measure your queries with and without this index that nevertheless seems
ill-advised.
