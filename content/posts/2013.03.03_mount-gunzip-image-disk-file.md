Some tips about a way to restore a very big gunzip'ed image disk from a network
share. I've changed of computer and my previous disk was saved in a image with
`dd` and a pipe on `gunzip`. The image is located on a network share. But I can
not restore the whole image because it uses too much spaces. Then, I will mount
this one but it was compressed. The solution is `mountavfs`. You can use this
command in order to open compressed files on the fly.

The steps are something like this:

```sh
avfsd -o allow_root ~/.avfs
mountavfs
```

Look at [avf.sourceforge.net](http://avf.sourceforge.net)

```sh
sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.1.1:backup ~/mybackup
```

Just my backup; mount yours as usual...

```sh
cd ~/.avfs/home/myuser/mybackup
```

Here, I will found my image disk file.

```sh
sudo mount -o ro,loop,offset=$((63 * 512)) backup.img.gz ~/dst
```

I mount my file from the `~/.avfs` directory (then it will be uncompressed on
the fly). I must specify the partition offset because the image is the whole
disk with a GPT structure. Look for `fdisk`, `gdisk` in order to retrieve the
offset. The first seems to be always 63th bloc.

Now you can see the whole content of your gunzip'ed image in the `~/dst`
directory.
