A very easy way to share your display

<!--more-->

# Share your display

When using X11, one of the simplest way to share your desktop remotly is by
using the [x11vnc][2] server.

> You can install it via `apt install x11vnc` for example

Connect to your remote server with SSH and starts [x11vnc][2] by this way:

```sh
x11vnc -display :0
```

Now you can open your display with your favourite viewer by using the display
`:0`.

> Remember that you can easily use a SSH jump with
> `ssh -C -J jumpuser@jumphost user@host`

If you prefer a graphical interface to open the VNC viewer, I suggest to use
[Remmina][1] which is a great application. It's easy to configure the SSH tunnel
for a jump.

## Do not use TeamViewer, AnyDesk, etc, ...

Some people prefer tools like TeamViewer. Even if it seems very useful, it's a
third service and you provide informations to third people. It's very easy to
keep the control of your systems and computers. As you can see here, it's very
simple to access remotly to your whole desktop (and not just some applications
via X forwarding) without a lot of settings and pain.

Stay free ...
