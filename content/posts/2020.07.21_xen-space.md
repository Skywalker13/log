Reclaim spaces on your hypervisor (dom-0)

<!--more-->

# The patches are hungry

When you install official patches on your Xen server (like XenServer 6.2 or
Citrix Hypervisor 8.2), it takes all spaces on your `dom-0`. The patches are
copied multiple times and nothing removes these files that should be useless
after a reboot.
