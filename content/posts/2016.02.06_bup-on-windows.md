One of the best backup tool

<!--more-->

One of the best tool that I know for incremental backups is
[**Bup**](https://bup.github.io). I'm using this great project for all my
backups with my Linux installation. But on the Windows side, it's an other
story. This post will explain how to deploy **Bup** and how to browse the
snapshots with the file browser.

## Install the environment

### Cygwin

The first step is to install the [**Cygwin**](https://www.cygwin.com/)
environment because **Bup** is written mainly for Unix OSes.

Download the **Cygwin** installer:
[setup-x86_64.exe](https://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe)

Follow the steps, then you should see this screen:

You must install the following packages: **python** (2.7),
**python-setuptools**, **git**, **make**, **rsync**, **gcc-core** (4.x),
**perl**, **par2**

Then you will have all the necessary tools in order to build and use **Bup**.

Open the **Cygwin** terminal and execute this script in the shell:

```bash
$ echo "export SHELLOPTS
set -o igncr" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

It fixes a problem with the scripts where a `\r` (carriage return) exists for
each line.

### Python

**Bup** wants **tornado** for it's web server. Then you must install the package
manager **pip** and then, **tornado**.

```bash
$ python -m ensurepip
$ pip install tornado
```

## Build Bup

The environment is installed, it's the time to build **Bup**.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bup/bup.git
$ cd bup
$ git checkout 0.27
$ make
```

Checkout the last release. Don't use the `HEAD` of master because it can be
unsafe for your backup.

### Install

```bash
$ make install DESTDIR=/opt/bup PREFIX=''
$ export PATH=/opt/bup/bin:$PATH
$ echo "export PATH=/opt/bup/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

If the build succeeds, you can install **Bup** in `/opt/bup` and update the
`PATH` environment variable.

You can check if **Bup** is working with this simple command:

```bash
$ bup --version
0.27
```

## Use Bup

The first step is to initialize a **Bup** repository. Note that **Bup** uses the
same packfile format of **Git**. Then the repository is initialized like with
**Git**.

> **Bup** uses **Git**, but it improves the way how the big files are stored.
> **Git** is not efficient with binary files, then **Bup** split the files in
> smaller chunks with it's own mechanism. But the repository is still readable
> with the common **Git** commands. The files just look different.

For my backups, I use a drive `z:`, then I configure **Bup** in order to
initialize the repository on this drive.

```bash
$ export BUP_DIR=/cygdrive/z/bup
$ echo "export BUP_DIR=/cygdrive/z/bup" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ bup init
```

### Backup

Very well, it's time to backup something.

- The first step is to generate the index.
- The second step is to save the files in a branch.
- And the last step is to generate the files for the parity with the great
  **par2** tool.

```bash
$ bup index /cygdrive/c/foobar
$ bup save -n foobar /cygdrive/c/foobar
$ bup fsck -g
```

> The last step is very slow, at least for the first time. The parity uses ~10%
> of the backup size. It's very important to do this step, it prevents
> corruptions like "bit rot".

### See the snapshots

There are several ways in order to work with the **Bup**'s snapshots. Just read
the manual for that. But an easy way is to use the web interface provided by
**Bup**.

```bash
$ bup web
Serving HTTP on 127.0.0.1:8080...
```

### Well, but what about Fuse?

Yes, it's the main problem on Windows. There is no easy way in order to have a
file system in user space like the great
[**Fuse**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) on Linux. And
of course, **Bup** supports **Fuse**. It's the one of the main reasons why
**Bup** is better on Linux.

Someone has done the work for adding webdav to the web server.

The first step is to install the **Cygwin** package **python-lxml**; then you
must build a fork of **Bup** 0.27 which adds the webdav support.

```bash
$ git remote add webdav https://github.com/wrouesnel/bup.git
$ git fetch webdav bup-web-improvements
$ git checkout bup-web-improvements
$ make
$ make install DESTDIR=/opt/bup PREFIX=''
$ bup web
```

Then now you can map a network drive to the following address:
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`

Have fun!
