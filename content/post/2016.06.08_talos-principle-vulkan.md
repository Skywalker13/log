+++

One of the best news of this year is clearly the new Khronos API **Vulkan**. The game "[The Talos Principle](http://www.croteam.com/talosprinciple/)" is mostly ported on this new API and the last [NVidia drivers](https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver) are supporting **Vulkan**.

Then I've updated my driver, and tried the Talos benchmark with **OpenGL** and **Vulkan**. The difference of performance is just very impressive. Even if **Vulkan** is still considered as beta by this game, it works pretty good.

# Benchmark

I've done three runs with **OpenGL** and with **Vulkan**. I use exactly the same graphic settings in both cases. Just the API has been changed. Note that I use the _amd64_ version of the game.

See by yourself...

## Results

- Average for OpenGL: **72.1 FPS**
- Average for Vulkan: **90.2 FPS** (increase of **~18 FPS**)

And note that all framerates are over **>60 FPS** with **Vulkan**. It's not the case with **OpenGL** where about _27% are below_. Maybe I will test with the same settings on Windows 10 too.
