# rpath

## On Darwin

On Linux it's very simple, just set the **rpath** with the linker or with
`patchelf`. On Darwin it's much harder because there are more possibilities. My
goal here is just to explain a way in order to provide an **rpath** like on
Linux.

The first step is the same that Linux. You must path **rpath** to the linker.

```sh
CFLAGS='-Wl,-rpath=@executable_path/../lib'
```

You will not a first difference. You can't use `$ORIGIN`, here you must use
`@executable_path` which has the same purpose. A good point for Apple, `[$]` is
not used then it's not a problem to use this placeholder with the shell or make.

> It's possible to use `@loader_path` but in this case, it's relative to the
> binary which is loading the other library and not the main executable. It
> makes sense mostly for frameworks but most of time you need only
> `@executable_path`.
