# It's a bit like a bad joke

I think that it's a joke because it's just useless for most people.

1. It runs only under Windows 10 (at least pro version?) and must be installed
   explicitly
2. It's slow as hell (please, use Linux not this thing)
3. It's just useless, kernel modules are unusable (like [FUSE][1] for example)

My first attempt with [WSL][4] was for [Bup][2] because it's not very efficient
by [this way](/post/2016.02.06_bup-on-windows). It's not for me, it's for
someone in my family where it's not _possible_ to move on Linux. And [Bup][2]
without [FUSE][1] is not very interresting for a Windows user.

When Microsoft has released [WSL][4] it was seen like something incredible with
bullshits like "Microsoft loves Linux", etc, ...

Hey guys... look at [Cooperative linux][3] projet. Ooooh.. it's just really fun
and exists since 2004 (Windows 2000 to Windows 7 (only 32 bits)). But it's no
longer maintained. It was the way to go...

## WSL2

Is [WSL2][5] the next Microsoft joke? because it will be a bit like [CoLinux][3]
(in 2004) because it will use a real Linux kernel. But maybe this time it will
be usable.
