# rpath

## Portable binaries on Linux

The **rpath** functionality is something that exists only on unix-like OS. It's
very powerful in order to manage the dynamic loading as you want. The goal here
is not to explain **rpath**; just use your favorite search engine for that. Here
I will told you how to use **rpath** in order to provide binaries and libraries
without [a dependency on the system paths][2] like `/usr/lib` and without the
use of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` which can be very dangerous and
even a bit limited on Darwin (see [SIP][1]).

## On Linux

It's simple but it's a bit more limited that on Darwin. In most of cases you
have your libraries in `lib` and the main executable in `bin`. It means that the
main executable must look for your libraries in `../lib`.

In order to add a relative path, you must link with `-rpath`. This attribute
must provides one or more paths where the dynamic libraries must be searched.
For relative path, it's possible to use a placeholder named `$ORIGIN` which is
the location of the main executable. Otherwise, you must pass an absolute
location.

You can pass this attribute with the `CFLAGS=-Wl` for the linker. For example:

```sh
CFLAGS='-Wl,-rpath=$ORIGIN/../lib'
```

> Note that the use of `[$]` can be a bit problematic because it can be expanded
> by the shell or by make. It must be escaped by `\$ORIGIN` with the shell and
> `$$ORIGIN` with make.

You can have more than one path just by doing like this:
`-Wl,-rpath=$ORIGIN/../lib:/opt/my/lib`.

See this example with the build of `curl` (I use `readelf` in order to see the
sections in the executable):

```sh
$ readelf -d ./usr/bin/curl

Dynamic section at offset 0x28dd0 contains 29 entries:
  Tag        Type                         Name/Value
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libcurl.so.4]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libssl.so.1.1]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libcrypto.so.1.1]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libz.so.1]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.6]
 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH)            Library runpath: [$ORIGIN/../lib]
 [...]]
```

An **rpath** value was added by the linker in the `RUNPATH` section. The same
must be done for the libraries, for example with `libcurl.so.4`:

```sh
$ readelf -d ./usr/lib/libcurl.so.4

Dynamic section at offset 0x68d20 contains 33 entries:
  Tag        Type                         Name/Value
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libidn.so.11]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [librtmp.so.1]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libssl.so.1.1]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libcrypto.so.1.1]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [liblber-2.4.so.2]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libldap_r-2.4.so.2]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libz.so.1]
 0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED)             Shared library: [libc.so.6]
 0x000000000000000e (SONAME)             Library soname: [libcurl.so.4]
 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH)            Library runpath: [$ORIGIN/../lib]
 [...]]
```

You can check that the loader is using the right paths with `ldd`:

```sh
$ ldd ./usr/bin/curl
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffccb787000)
        libcurl.so.4 => /home/schroeterm/usr/bin/../lib/libcurl.so.4 (0x00007fb817e5f000)

        librtmp.so.1 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librtmp.so.1 (0x00007fb816cf7000)
        liblber-2.4.so.2 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblber-2.4.so.2 (0x00007fb816ae8000)
        libldap_r-2.4.so.2 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libldap_r-2.4.so.2 (0x00007fb816897000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fb816691000)
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fb816474000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x000055a978e49000)

        libsasl2.so.2 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsasl2.so.2 (0x00007fb8155b9000)
        libp11-kit.so.0 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libp11-kit.so.0 (0x00007fb815354000)
        libtasn1.so.6 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtasn1.so.6 (0x00007fb815141000)
        libffi.so.6 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.6 (0x00007fb814f38000)
```

You can see with `ldd` that a lot of libraries are still pointing on the system
paths. The reason is that I've just rebuilt `libcurl`, `libssl`, `libcrypto` and
`libz`. I'm sure at least for these libraries that it's using my own versions
and not the versions provided by my system. I can move the `bin` and `lib`
directory together without breaking something because I'm using a relative
**rpath**.

If you are using `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, you should consider to rebuild everything
properly with **rpath** because you can break some libraries otherwise. If I try
`ldd` on `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnutls.so.30` (which is a dependency of
my `curl`, you will see `libz` too; but it's not the same):

```sh
$ ldd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnutls.so.30
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc915ec000)
        libz.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so.1 (0x00007f702f95d000)
        libp11-kit.so.0 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libp11-kit.so.0 (0x00007f702f6f8000)
        libidn.so.11 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libidn.so.11 (0x00007f702f4c4000)
        libtasn1.so.6 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtasn1.so.6 (0x00007f702f2b1000)
        libnettle.so.6 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnettle.so.6 (0x00007f702f07a000)
        libhogweed.so.4 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libhogweed.so.4 (0x00007f702ee43000)
        libgmp.so.10 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgmp.so.10 (0x00007f702ebc0000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f702e822000)
        libffi.so.6 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.6 (0x00007f702e619000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f702e415000)
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f702e1f8000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x000055e562126000)
```

It means that `./usr/bin/curl` depends of
`libz.so.1 => /home/schroeterm/usr/bin/../lib/libz.so.1 (0x00007fb817531000)`
and `libgnutls.so.30 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnutls.so.30`. But
`libgnutls` depends of
`libz.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so.1 (0x00007f702f95d000)`.

You can see two `libz` files. One in my own tree, and a second one in the system
tree. With **rpath**, everything is fine because each library uses the right
dependencies.

But if I use `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, I break the dependencies:

```sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/schroeterm/usr/lib ldd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnutls.so.30
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffec8df0000)
        libz.so.1 => /home/schroeterm/usr/lib/libz.so.1 (0x00007fb899560000)
        libp11-kit.so.0 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libp11-kit.so.0 (0x00007fb8992b2000)
        libidn.so.11 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libidn.so.11 (0x00007fb89907e000)
        libtasn1.so.6 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtasn1.so.6 (0x00007fb898e6b000)
        libnettle.so.6 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnettle.so.6 (0x00007fb898c34000)
        libhogweed.so.4 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libhogweed.so.4 (0x00007fb8989fd000)
        libgmp.so.10 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgmp.so.10 (0x00007fb89877a000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fb8983dc000)
        libffi.so.6 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libffi.so.6 (0x00007fb8981d3000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fb897fcf000)
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fb897db2000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x000055684a461000)
```

In this case, `libgnutls` is using my own `libz` version and it's not what I
want. Most of time it works fine, but sometimes it breaks your runtime. Then I
repeat, you should never use `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (or similar).

### patchelf

Maybe you can not rebuild the libraries, or maybe it's too difficult to pass
`$ORIGIN` by command line because it's expanded by the shell and/or by make.
It's possible to patch the binaries after the linking by using
**[patchelf][3]**.

> Do not use [`chrpath`][4], it's too limited because when the new **rpath** is
> longer, it's not possible to change the value.

To set the **rpath** with `patchelf`, it's very simple:

```sh
patchelf --set-rpath '$ORIGIN/../lib' ./usr/bin/curl
```
