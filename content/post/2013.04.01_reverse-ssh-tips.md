SSH like Super SH...

<!--more-->

[`cd ~`](/)

Today I will share some tips with SSH. It is very useful every time even with
crappy OS like Windows. One of the most funny feature is the TCP forwarding by
Reverse SSH. For example in the case where you must connect to a SSH server and
this one is behind a firewall. You have no access to the firewall because you
are at work.

### First one

You must connect the computer (behind the firewall) to a server available on
Internet (at home).

```sh
ssh -R 8888:localhost:22 homeuser@homeip -p 8888
```

It will create an SSH tunnel with your computer at home. You can choose an other
port; 8888 is just for the example.

### Second one

At home, you can connect to your computer at work by this way :

```sh
ssh workuser@localhost -p 8888
```

Easy, isn't it? Note that is possible to forward every things with SSH. All
local servers in your company...

### But, with Windows it's a pain

Not really, just use Cygwin. You can install openssh-server with the packages
manager. Just use `ssh-host-config -y` from the Cygwin terminal. Start the
terminal with admin rights if necessary. A service will be installed in order to
start openssh. Start the service and enjoy.

You should search on the web for more examples and tips. Here you will found the
essential.
