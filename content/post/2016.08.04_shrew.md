Sometimes you want to execute a command in a script in your `package.json`
file; and this command must change something in the root directory. Because
the `node_modules/` directories can be nested (even with node `>=5`), it's
not possible to use the parent directory.

The [shrew](https://github.com/Xcraft-Inc/shrew) module will help you in
this case.

```sh
npm install --save shrew
```

Please, consult the **README** for more details.
